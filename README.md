This repository contains my solution to Advent of Code 2023 https://adventofcode.com/

The programming language chosen is Java JDK 1.8 or higher and the code editor I used is VSCode although you can use IntelliJ, or any other of your preference.

It is organized by days, where main class is the name of the day. For instance, you would find day one solution in DayOne/DayOne.java, just make sure you edit the location of your puzzle, by default is the demo puzzle offered by Advent of Code, and run it normally, as any Java main class.

Hope you find it interesting and fun, and, of course, if you feel like you would like to improve my code, please do not hesitate to get in touch with me and even open a Pull Request!!

Have fun, Happy Advent!
